# N-Queen
ðŸ§© What is the N-Queens Problem?
The N-Queens Problem is a classic computer science puzzle. The challenge is:

Place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.

ðŸ‘‘ Rules:
A queen in chess can move:

Horizontally (same row)

Vertically (same column)

Diagonally (both directions)

So, you must place queens such that:

No two queens are in the same row

No two queens are in the same column

No two queens are on the same diagonal
